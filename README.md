# Machine Learning Lab Projects

## Introduction

These projects are related to methods and algorithms of machine learning and neural networks. All projects are using datasets `heart.csv` and `advertising.csv` for tasks of regression and classification (from EDA to models integrating). Also, it's worth mentioning that Labs which are about using models use preprocessed datasets `heart_updated.csv` and `advertising_updated.csv`.

## Lab Projects

1.  EDA and datasets preprocessing (feature extraction, feature transformation, feature selection);
2.  Usage of Stochastic Gradient Descent model for tasks of regression and classification with preprocessed datasets;
3.  *to be continued soonâ€¦*
